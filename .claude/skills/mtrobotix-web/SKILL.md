# MTRobotix website — design rules

Binding for everyone who changes this site: people, agents, scripts. If a request conflicts with a
rule, say so and offer the in-system option. Extend the system by adding a rule here, never by a
one-off exception in a component.

**The look in one line:** warm white, navy ink, one red accent, condensed headings, generous but
never empty space, motion that is felt more than seen.

## 1. Principles

1. **Minimal.** Every element earns its place. If removing it loses nothing, remove it.
2. **Straightforward.** One message per section, one primary action per view.
3. **Attractive through restraint.** Quality comes from type, spacing, real product imagery and
   small precise motion — not from decoration, gradients, glows or effects.
4. **Fast.** Static pages, self-hosted fonts, one small site script (`src/scripts/site.ts`) plus
   the product animations and the home hero field, each its own small module. No UI frameworks,
   no animation libraries, no web-font CDNs.

## 2. Theme colours

Defined only in `src/styles/tokens.css`. Never hard-code a hex, rgba, font, spacing or duration
that a token carries. New token → add it there with a one-line comment saying why.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg` | `#faf9f6` | Page ground (warm white) |
| `--color-bg-soft` | `#f2f1ec` | Alternate sections (`.section-soft`), media backdrops |
| `--color-surface` | `#ffffff` | Cards, frames, panels |
| `--color-text` | `#17181a` | Body text, headings |
| `--color-text-muted` | `#5b5d63` | Leads, labels, secondary text |
| `--color-text-faint` | `#8b8d92` | Captions, step numbers |
| `--color-line` / `--color-line-strong` | `#e6e4dc` / `#c9c5ba` | Hairlines, borders |
| `--color-ink` | `#1d2d3d` | Brand navy: primary buttons, wordmark "ROBOTIX", active underline |
| `--color-brand-red` | `#e5463d` | Only the "MT" of the wordmark, and defect red in diagrams |
| `--color-accent` | `#2f5d8a` | Links, stat values, list ticks, focus ring |
| `--color-pass` | `#2f7d52` | "Good part" in inspection diagrams only |
| `--color-wip` | `#8a5a12` | "Work in progress" badge only |

- Light theme only (`color-scheme: light`).
- Colour carries meaning, never decoration. No gradients on UI, no coloured section backgrounds
  beyond `--color-bg-soft`.
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 against its background.

## 3. Type

- Headings: **Barlow Condensed 600** (`--font-heading`). Body: **Barlow 400/500** (`--font-body`).
  Self-hosted in `public/fonts/`, Vietnamese subsets included.
- Scale: `--text-xs … --text-h1`, `--text-lead`, `--text-stat`. No other sizes.
- One `<h1>` per page. Headings in sentence case, `text-wrap: balance`.
- Body text max width `--measure` (62ch).
- Small uppercase labels (`.kicker`) are the only all-caps text, besides the wordmark.
- Wordmark: `MT` red + `ROBOTIX` navy, letter-spaced 0.28em (`Wordmark.astro`). In the header it
  folds to `MTR` once the page scrolls. Never restyle, recolour or re-letter it.

## 4. Layout and spacing

- Content sits in `.shell` (max `--shell` 74rem, side gutter `--space-page-gutter`).
- Spacing only from `--space-1 … --space-9`. Pick the smallest step that separates the things:
  - inside a component: `--space-2` to `--space-4`
  - between blocks in a section: `--space-5` to `--space-6`
  - between columns: `--space-7`
  - section padding: `.section` (`--space-8`, `--space-7` on mobile). Never stack extra margins on
    top of it.
- No unnecessary spacing: no empty spacer elements, no `<br>` for layout, no padding added to
  "make it breathe" when the section already has rhythm. Use `gap` on flex/grid, not margins on
  children.
- Two columns (`.two-col`, hero grids) collapse to one at **900px**. Other breakpoint: **720px**.
  Nothing else.
- No horizontal scroll at 320px.
- Sections alternate `bg` / `bg-soft` and are divided by a hairline; never boxed in borders.

## 5. Components (reuse, do not reinvent)

| Component | Rule |
|---|---|
| Button | Pill (`.btn`). Primary = navy fill (`.btn-primary`), one per view. Secondary = hairline outline. Min height `--hit`. |
| Text link | `.text-link`, accent colour, arrow icon after. |
| Frame | `.frame`: white surface, hairline, `--radius-lg`, around every product image or diagram. |
| Card | Product cards (`ProductCards.astro`): image 4:3 on top, title, one line, "Learn more". Hover: lift 2px + shadow. |
| Kicker | `.kicker` above a section title. Short, 1–3 words. |
| Ticks | `.ticks` for benefit lists: 3–4 items, each one short line. |
| Badge | `.badge` / `.badge-soon` for status only ("Work in progress", "Details coming soon"). |
| Facts | `.facts` label/value rows for specs. Unknown value → leave it out or "TBD", never a guess. |
| Back to top | `BackToTop.astro`: round white button bottom-right after the first screen, ring shows scroll progress. |
| Icons | `@lucide/astro`, `stroke-width={1.5}`, 16–22px. No emoji. |

Radius: pills for controls, `--radius-lg` for cards/frames/panels, `--radius-md` inside them.
Shadows only for hover and floating elements (`--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`).

## 6. Motion — simple, short, purposeful

- Only **opacity** and **translate** (≤ 12px). No scale pops, bounce, spin, parallax, blur or
  colour flashes.
- One curve: `--ease`. Durations: `--dur-fast` 150ms (hover), `--dur` 260ms (UI state),
  `--dur-slow` 520ms (entrances, reveals). Nothing longer, except product animations.
- Patterns in use — use these, do not add new kinds:
  - **Page entrance:** hero copy and image rise in once, in reading order (`rise` keyframes).
    The home hero copy instead wipes in left to right (clip + ≤ 12px slide, `hero-wipe` in
    `Home.astro`), still once per load.
  - **Home hero field:** `src/scripts/hero-pool.ts` (from the Portfolio site). Hidden dots the
    cursor pushes aside, lit in `--color-accent`, crosshair cursor, normal cursor over controls.
    Home hero only, desktop only (wider than 900px, mouse); stops when at rest; off under reduced
    motion.
  - **Reveal on scroll:** `data-reveal`; list items set `--d` (0, 1, 2…) to stagger by `--stagger`.
  - **Page switch:** cross-document view transition, short cross-fade; the header stays put.
  - **Header:** border appears after scrolling; wordmark folds to `MTR` and back.
  - **Hover:** colour/border change, cards lift 2px.
- Product animations (MetriQ line, AMR) loop calmly, explain one idea each, pause when off screen,
  and show a still frame under reduced motion.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` turns all of it off. Every new motion must respect it.

## 7. Imagery

- Real product photos and renders only, in a `.frame`. No stock photos, no illustrations of
  people, no decorative backgrounds.
- Renders: studio light on a warm-white backdrop that matches `--color-bg-soft`, product centred,
  three-quarter view. Keep the script that made a render in `scripts/renders/` (never in `public/`).
- Card and product-hero images are 4:3. Export WebP, ≤ 250 KB where possible, with `width` and
  `height` set. Hero image `fetchpriority="high"`, everything else `loading="lazy"`.
- Every image has real alt text in both languages.

## 8. Copy — no filler

- Say it once, plainly, in the fewest words that are still clear. Lead with the benefit or the
  action.
- No buffer words: "simply", "just", "easily", "seamless", "cutting-edge", "state-of-the-art",
  "innovative", "solutions" (as filler), "leverage", "robust", "world-class", "in order to",
  "we are proud to".
- Numbers are exact and sourced: `<1mm`, `0 downtime`, `0.4s per part`. Never invent a number,
  customer, price or claim. Facts come from the sources named at the top of `src/data/content.ts`;
  unknown → leave it out.
- Every string exists in **English and Vietnamese**, in `src/data/content.ts` or `src/data/i18n.ts`.
  Never hard-code copy in a component.
- Buttons: verb first ("See MetriQ", "Contact us"). Sentence case.

## 9. Accessibility (must pass)

- Visible focus ring (`--color-accent`, 2px). Hit targets ≥ `--hit` (44px).
- Landmarks: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`. Icon-only buttons have `aria-label`.
- Canvas/SVG animations: `role="img"` with an `aria-label` describing what they show.

## Review checklist

Tokens only · one primary button · Barlow / Barlow Condensed only · no extra spacing, gaps from the
scale · 900/720 breakpoints only · 320px no sideways scroll · motion = opacity + small translate,
reduced motion honoured · real imagery in a frame, 4:3, WebP · copy has no filler, EN + VI, every
fact sourced.
